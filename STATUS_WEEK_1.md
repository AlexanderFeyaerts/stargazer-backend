Our teamwork is going good, everyone is researching something.
Friday we made nice progress with controlling the camera and telescope, which is a huge step in the right direction.
We mostly focused on learning new technology and talked about how we see our flow from application to raspberry pi backend.
Next week we want to start building. Our goal is on to have a working list of celestial bodies with updated coordinates.
And a way to convert them to the correct input and to be able to configure camera settings.

# milestones
- taking a picture with raspberry pi 
- sending bytes to telescope so it moves from node.js

# current issues
- researching how to configuring cameras with node.js/raspberry pi
- researching how to configuring telescopes with node.js
- researching celestial bodies coordinates and how to calculate it + conversion to byte
- researching react native
- researching node.js
- startup node.js back-end proj
- startup react native project (StarGazer)
